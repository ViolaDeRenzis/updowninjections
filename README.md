## Credits

You are welcome to use this dataset in your research. We kindly ask you to cite the paper above. If you want to cite this data release specifically, the DOI code is: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7974557.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7974557).


## Data

Data need to be downloaded from the [github release page](https://github.com/ViolaDeRenzis/updowninjections/releases). The total size is ~56GB. To download the entire dataset use our `download_all.py` script.


We provide two types of data products, named `*.json` and `Backpropagation_*.dat`
- The `*.json` files are the raw bilby outputs, see [here](https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/bilby/bilby-output.html) for instructions. Each of these files contains a nested set of dictionaries with all the information of the injection (true values, waveform arguments, priors, posteriors, log evidence etc...). 
- The `Backpropagation_*.dat` files contain the posterior samples of the tilt angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ that are numerically evolved from $20$ Hz to $0$ Hz. The first (second) column is the posterior distribution of $\theta_1$ ($\theta_2$). The posterior distributions for the tilt angles at $20$ Hz are contained in the `*.json` files.


## Readme

The data provided refer to the results of the paper as follows:

- Data to reproduce Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 of the paper are listed as `ud_rX_SNR_YYY.json` where `ud` stands for *up-down*,`X` ranges from 1 to 8 and refers to the 8 series of injections shown in Fig. 3 performed with different values of the orbital separation `r` and with an `YYY` value of the $\mathrm{SNR}$. The chosen values of the $\mathrm{SNR}$ for the 8 series are $\mathrm{SNR}=150,100,80,60,40,20$. The files that reproduce the injection set of Fig. 2 (and the orange scatter points of Fig.3) are `ud_r1_SNR_YYY`, with `YYY`$=150,100,80,60,40,20$.

- The files to reproduce the posterior distribution at $20$ Hz in Fig. 4 are `ud_r1_SNR_150.json` (left panel) and `ud_r6_SNR_150.json` (right panel). The posterior distribution of the tilt angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ at $0$ Hz are contained in `Backpropagation_r1_SNR_150.dat` (left panel) and `Backpropagation_r6_SNR_150.dat` (right panel).

- The files for the 151 injections used in Fig. 5 of the paper are named as `updown_X.json`, where `X` ranges between 0 and 150. For all these runs, injection and recovery are done with the IMRPhenomXPHM waveform model using the standard uninformative priors (see the paper). The injection performed without higher modes are called `updown_X_noHM.json` where $X=39,61,99,104,113,125,138$.
